## ⚙️ Requirements

-   Python 3.8+
-   Streamlit
-   MySQL Server
-   Groq API Key
-   Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

Install all required Python dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ai-journal.git](https://github.com/your-username/ai-journal.git)
cd ai-journal
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with your credentials.

```
MYSQL_HOST=127.0.0.1
MYSQL_USER=your_mysql_user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
MYSQL_DATABASE=ai_journal
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```

### 3. Set Up MySQL Database

Ensure your MySQL server is running. Connect to your MySQL server and run the commands in the `sql/schema.sql` file. This will create the `ai_journal` database and all the necessary tables (`daily_entries`, `weekly_summaries`, `monthly_summaries`, `chat_history`).

You can do this via a command line client or by pasting the contents into a GUI tool like MySQL Workbench.

```bash
mysql -u your_user -p < sql/schema.sql
```

### 4. Run the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application should now be running and accessible in your web browser.

### 5. Run the Summarization Scripts (Optional)

To generate weekly or monthly summaries, you can run the scripts manually from your terminal. These are designed to be automated (e.g., with cron jobs).

```bash
# To generate a summary for the previous week
python scripts/weekly_summarizer.py

# To generate a summary for the previous month
python scripts/monthly_summarizer.py
```

## ✍️ How to Use the App

-   **New Entry**: Navigate to this page from the sidebar to write and save your journal entry for a specific date.
-   **Query Entries**: Ask the AI questions about your journal. Select a date range to narrow the context for the AI.
-   **Chat History**: View your past questions and the AI's answers. You can also filter this history by date.
-   **All Entries**: Browse your entire journal history. Use the date pickers to search for a specific period.

## 🛠 Future Improvements

-   **User Authentication**: Implement a login system for private, multi-user journaling.
-   **Sentiment Analysis**: Add visualizations to track mood and sentiment over time.
-   **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy the application to a cloud service like Streamlit Community Cloud or AWS.
-   **Enhanced Summaries**: Improve the summary query logic to fetch and use the pre-generated weekly/monthly summaries for faster, more efficient responses.
